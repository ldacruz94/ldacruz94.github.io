### 📚 Back to School

For years, I wanted to pursue a higher level of education. I wasn't able to for a long time due to financial constraints and my inability to receive financial aid because of my previous immigration status in the country. It was tough accepting that I couldn’t go to school. The weight of that reality gnawed at me for years, as I watched others move forward in their academic pursuits while I stood still, wanting more for myself but feeling helpless.

Nonetheless, that didn’t stop me from feeding my hunger for knowledge. I turned to books, becoming my own teacher. I explored a wide variety of topics that piqued my curiosity. Whether it was philosophy, theology, culinary arts, music theory, history, or computer science, I found myself constantly diving into new material. I figured that since formal education often involves learning from books, then why couldn’t I do the same on my own? After all, books are written by experts attempting to convey knowledge. So why wouldn’t I be able to absorb that information directly?

I started to challenge the traditional assumptions about education. Was there something intrinsic in me that would prevent me from gaining knowledge without an institution? Was I not capable of understanding words on a page? Does knowledge only flow through the doors of a brick-and-mortar school? For me, the answer was obvious: No. The pursuit of knowledge could, and should, happen anywhere, and my circumstances wouldn’t prevent me from learning.

That being said, I’m not here to argue that traditional brick and mortar schools are worthless. Quite the opposite. Returning to pursue my bachelor's degree after all these years underscores the importance I place on formal education. What I’m trying to convey is that my drive to learn has always come from within. My curiosity is what led me (and continues to lead me) to seek knowledge, whether through self-directed learning or through a structured academic path. It’s never been about external pressure or validation.

There are a few reasons why I decided to finally return to school. One major motivation is the desire to advance my career. While I’ve built a successful foundation as a software engineer, I realize that obtaining a degree opens up opportunities for higher-level positions and better salaries. In a field as competitive as technology, formal credentials still carry weight.

Another reason is to combat the imposter syndrome that has followed me throughout my career. Even after years of hands-on experience and numerous projects, there’s always that small voice in the back of my mind questioning whether I’m truly qualified. Having a degree won’t completely erase those doubts, I know, but it’s a step toward quieting them.

I also want to fill any knowledge gaps I might have as a self-taught software engineer. While I’ve learned a great deal on my own, through the teachers and experts of the books I've read, I know there are areas that require deeper, structured learning to become more well-rounded. That’s something a formal education can provide—a comprehensive approach that connects the dots in ways I might not have seen before.

But perhaps the most exciting reason for returning to school is my desire to explore new avenues within IT. Right now, I primarily focus on web and internal tool development, and I love it. But I want more. I’m fascinated by fields like Artificial Intelligence, Embedded Engineering, Robotics, and Quantum Computing. These are areas that require a diverse and sophisticated skill set, and I believe a higher level of education is crucial for diving into them.

Achieving my first degree isn’t just a personal milestone; it’s the stepping stone for my long-term goals. I’ve always had my eye on postgraduate studies, and eventually, I hope to pursue a PhD. While it may seem premature to talk about a doctorate now, I see it as part of a natural progression. If I continue to be drawn to research-based roles later in my career, then having a PhD will be invaluable.

Of course, this journey won’t be easy. Balancing school with a full-time job and a family is a challenge that requires constant adjustment. But I’m confident that the time and effort will pay off. This isn’t just about ticking a box; it’s about growth, discovery, and challenging myself to push further than I’ve gone before.

### Conclusion:
Returning to school isn’t just about securing a better job or earning a degree for me—it’s about reclaiming my path, feeding my curiosity, and opening doors to new opportunities. While my self-education has been invaluable, this formal journey represents the next chapter in my pursuit of knowledge and personal development. Education, whether formal or self-taught, has always been a cornerstone in my life, and now, I’m building on that foundation to reach new heights. I’m excited to see where this road will lead and to discover the possibilities that lie ahead.

### ❔ Some questions for reflection:

As I reflect on my journey back to school and the challenges I've faced, here are some questions I invite you to think about:

1. **Have you ever wanted to pursue a goal but felt held back by circumstances outside of your control? What steps did you take to overcome those barriers?**
   
2. **What areas of your life or career have you taught yourself? How has self-learning shaped who you are today?**

3. **Is there something you’ve always wanted to study or explore but haven't yet? What’s stopping you from starting now?**

4. **Do you believe that formal education is the only path to success, or do you see value in self-education as well? How do you balance the two?**

5. **What new skills or fields of knowledge excite you? How can you start exploring them today, even in small ways?**

Take some time to reflect on these questions and consider how they apply to your own life. I’d love to hear your thoughts—feel free to [reach out](mailto:lucaspavesi11@gmail.com) if you want to share your reflections!
