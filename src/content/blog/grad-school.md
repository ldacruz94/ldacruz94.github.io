## New Chapter

As it is typical of my character, I've decided to add another thing to my almost full plate 😅. I recently got accepted to Georgia Tech's Masters of Computer Science of which
I'm looking to start this Fall. I will no doubt only do one class per semester as I have heard and read that the course material is very rigorous.

As for specializations, I've been in-between a few like Computer Perception and Robotics, Computing Systems, and Artificial Intelligence, but I think I have
decided to pursue Computing Systems. The reason is because I want to get into more lower-level systems and the courses that I'm interested in are more systems-based anyway.
Regardless, the specializations don't matter that much since you do have the opportunity to take a plethora of different courses/electives that span into other specializations. 

## Looking Forward

I'm looking forward to learning more about systems - especially operating systems! I'm brushing up on C++ and distributed systems so that I can be more prepared for the material of
some of the courses that I'm interested in taking. Some will require a good dosage of Python which I already have, so it's more of just focusing on C++ now which is the perfect
excuse for me to dive deeper into the language. I have also taken the liberty of studying up on data structures and algorithms and I have been practicing by solving a couple of leetcode/hackerrank problems. It's been a lot more 
fun than I thought it would be. 

I have been looking forward to applying to Georgia Tech for like 2-3 years now so to finally get to apply and be admitted has been a great feeling. My current mindset was the opposite of how my mindset was 5 years ago regarding going to uni. However, I did tell myself right before I started for my Bachelor's that once I finished, I wasn't going to stop until I completed a Masters or a PhD, so I'm glad I've been consistent with that mindset. God-willing, it'll payoff in the near future. Unless of course, Generative AI takes over everything. In which case, it was fun while it lasted 😅. I could always switch to plumbing 😀🔧.
