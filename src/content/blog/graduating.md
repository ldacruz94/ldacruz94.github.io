# Reflections

Finally, I did it!

In this last term, I dove headfirst into Discrete Mathematics II, spending most of the summer buried in simple modulus equations, variations of the Euclidean algorithm, recursive algorithms and their properties, discrete probability, and more. Once that course was behind me, I powered through a stack of gen-ed and CS courses, finishing with three AI/ML classes, two of which were capstone-level.

I’m glad I tackled the hardest courses first; it freed me up to take lighter ones toward the end—except, of course, for those last AI-heavy classes. If I’d saved the toughest subjects for later, I’m pretty sure that my motivation and momentum would’ve taken a hit, which would have slowed me down.

One of the biggest lessons I’ve taken away—beyond the technical skills—was mastering time management. Juggling three kids, two jobs, and coursework forced me to find the most efficient way to handle responsibilities without sacrificing quality. Whether carving out one-on-one time with my kids or meeting work deadlines, I learned to focus on what mattered most in each area of life. Sure, there were moments I wish I’d prioritized more—beach trips with my family or hanging out with friends more than once a month—but balancing everything perfectly is nearly impossible. Sometimes giving your best means accepting that some areas won’t get as much attention as you’d like.

Yesterday, when I announced I’d be graduating, my family’s excitement made it all worthwhile. The highlight was my son, who has autism, telling me, “Congratulations, Papai” (“Papai” is “daddy” in Portuguese). That little moment—his voice, his smile—is something I’ll replay for years to come 😭. I can’t wait for him to see me walk across the stage and, hopefully, remember this milestone.

# Next
I’m deeply grateful—for my family’s support, for God’s grace throughout this journey, and for friends who have cheered me on. I’ll lean on them again as I step into the next chapter: pursuing a master’s in computer science. My goal is Georgia Tech’s OMSCS program, particularly the specialization in Computational Perception and Robotics. If that doesn’t pan out, I’ll explore other strong CS programs, including WGU’s affordable and flexible master's program.

Most likely, I’ll begin in Fall 2026, since Spring deadlines have already passed. Until then, I have plenty of reading to do. I’m wrapping up a book on ROS 2 to get more comfortable with the framework, and next up is a deep dive into linear algebra. Not to mention a giant Lord of the Rings book that my got me for my birthday last year. 😄

Soli Deo Gloria
