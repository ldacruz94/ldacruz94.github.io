### ðŸŽ‰ Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‰

Last year, I was pursuing a Software Engineering major at my university. Although I progressed faster than expected, completing ten coursesâ€”far more than the original four I thought I could handleâ€”I still didnâ€™t feel satisfied with my major.

To be clear, as a "self-taught" software engineer, I personally donâ€™t think your major ultimately determines your success in this industry. If youâ€™re passionate, work hard at learning on your own, and have an aptitude for picking up new skills, I believe you can excel as a software engineer regardless of your academic path.

However, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to higher academic pursuits, and many niche fields in tech fascinate meâ€”areas like Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, and Systems Engineering, to name a few. In my view, earning a CS degree could open doors that might be harder to access with a Software Engineering degree.

I could be wrong, but I wanted to address this nagging feeling that I wasnâ€™t making the best decision for my career and future. Given my wide range of interests in tech and the fact that Iâ€™m still early in my career, I felt a CS degree would make me more versatile and better equipped to explore the specializations Iâ€™m passionate about.

### The Process of Switching to CS
Switching from Software Engineering to Computer Science required me to brush up on mathâ€”a lot of math. I revisited Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, and finally Calculus. I spent countless late nights and hours reviewing these subjects, but surprisingly, I didnâ€™t find it exhausting. In factâ€”and I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m saying thisâ€”I actually enjoyed it. Iâ€™ve always been good at math but never cared for it in school, so itâ€™s ironic how much I enjoy studying it now.

The focus on math was essential because my university requires either Pre-Calculus or Calculus as a prerequisite for the CS program. To meet this requirement, I enrolled in a Calculus course at a partner institution. So, in addition to completing all my other courses, I also tackled Calculusâ€”all while juggling life with a newborn. Looking back, I sometimes wonder how I managed it, but time seems to fly once the work is done.

### Whatâ€™s Next?
Since switching majors, Iâ€™ve completed one course in Networking and Security Foundations, which required me to refresh my knowledge of networking and security concepts while also learning some new ones.

Up next are several courses, including:

- Introduction to Computer Science
- Fundamentals of Information Systems
- Scripting and Programming (using C++ as the language of choice)
- Introduction to Systems Thinking and Applications

### Progress So Far
Here are the courses Iâ€™ve completed that are relevant to my CS major:

- Natural Science Lab
- Web Development Foundations
- Version Control
- Calculus
- Applied Probability and Statistics
- Data Management - Foundations
- Data Management - Applications
- Network and Security - Foundations
- Composition
- Scripting and Programming - Foundations

My current term ends this month, but Iâ€™ve already enrolled in Fundamentals of Information Security and am working to complete it before the term concludes.

### Wrapping Up
The nagging feeling is gone, and Iâ€™m more confident in my decision to change paths. Iâ€™m excited to hit the ground running, now fully committed to my studies in Computer Science. Hereâ€™s to an incredible year of learning and growth ahead!

Looking forward to seeing what this year brings in my academic journey!
