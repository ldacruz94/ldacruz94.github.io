			This was my first programming book ever. It introduced me
            to Computer Sciecne and programming using Python. It covers
            fundamental concepts like variables, control structures, functions,
            and data structures. I spent countless hours working through the exercises and examples, like
            building 3D shapes and other small programs to help understand
            the fundamentals of programming and the Python language.

            This is a great book that helped me understand computers
            when I was a complete noob in the tech world. Had no idea
            how computers worked and this book help demystify a lot of my
            ideas (and lack thereof) on them. Very useful if you're coming
            from a non-technical background into the field. It takes you
            through the a high-level history of computing.
