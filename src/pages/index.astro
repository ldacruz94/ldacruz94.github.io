				<h5 class="delay_order1"><span class="wave-emoji">👋🏼</span> Hi, there! I'm <b>Lucas Da Cruz</b>.</h5> 
				<p class="delay_order2">
					I am a Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience specializing in backend development, API design, and distributed systems. 
					Beyond backend, I have hands-on experience building modern frontends and implementing DevSecOps solutions. 
					My main focus is on building scalable, efficient applications while exploring emerging technologies like AI, robotics, and cloud computing.
				</p>
				<p class="delay_order3">
					At <a class="underline" href="https://www.ecolab.com/" target="_blank">Ecolab</a>, I've delivered impactful solutions across the full stack. 
					I contributed to distributed IoT systems processing real-time data from tens of thousands of devices with automated alerting capabilities. 
					Building RESTful APIs and microservices, I enhanced system performance and reliability.
					On the frontend, I co-led the delivery of an Executive Business Review application serving 300+ global account managers. 
					I also built infrastructure and developer tooling to improve engineering velocity and system observability.
				</p>
				<p class="delay_order4">
					Beyond my full-time work, I engage in freelance projects with startups and small businesses, delivering automation solutions that drive operational efficiency. 
					At <a class="underline" href="https://www.torchlight.care/" target="_blank">Torchlight</a>, I modernized their test automation by migrating legacy Selenium suites to Playwright, 
					significantly improving reliability and reducing test runtime. I also developed Python tools for concurrent link auditing and built automated report generation mechanisms 
					that reduced manual reporting time from days to just hours.
				</p>
				<p class="delay_order5">
					During my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies, <a href="/library">reading books</a>, blogging, cooking, and spending time
					with my wife and three kids. Check out my <a href="/projects">projects page</a> to see more of the work I'm passionate about -
					from backend systems and frontend applications to infrastructure and developer tools.
