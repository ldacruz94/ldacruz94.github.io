					I am a Software Engineer passionate about building efficient and scalable applications and systems. 
					My main focus is on backend development, but I also enjoy working on frontend and DevOps tasks as well as
					evolving my skills as an engineer in different technologies, such as
					AI, robotics, embedded systems, and cloud computing.
				</p>

					Currently, I am a Software Engineer at <a class="underline" href="https://www.ecolab.com/" target="_blank">Ecolab</a>
					building internal tools to help various teams (both engineering and non-engineering) and divisions at our organization be more efficient 
					and productive. I also assist in maintaining and improving the company's software development
					lifecycle and DevOps practices.

					In addition to my full-time job, I work as a freelance automation engineer for startups and small businesses, helping them
					to automate their processes and workflows using various tools and technologies. Currently, I 
					provide my services as a freelance engineer to

					I introduce new tools to help improve their QE tests and develop internal tools to automate 
					and enhance their processes.
